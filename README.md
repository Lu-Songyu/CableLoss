# CableLoss
This is aimed to help combine xml file for cable loss file.

In my work, I usually have to combine two or more XML files to configure cable loss for 5G NR testing purpose. It is time-consuming and quick frankly, not worth of my time. So I wrote this quiet python file to do it for me. It is functional, but I will continue adding nicer features. 

TO DO:
1. Be able to add files with different size, and still match frequency and cable loss.
2. Be able to extrapolate missing measurement. If required.
3. clean up the hardcode part.
4. Try to make a Tkinter UI Page to make it easier to use.
5. Keysight if you are seeing this you can take it, free of charge.
